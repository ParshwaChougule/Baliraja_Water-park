## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Firebase Realtime Database configured
- Website dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### Running the Website
```bash
cd /Users/tusharpawar/Downloads/Baliraja/website
npm install
npm start
```

The website will be available at: `http://localhost:3001`

### Accessing Bookings
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/bookings`
2. Or click "Check Bookings" button in header
3. Or click "Check Bookings" link in footer

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Firebase Realtime DB → realtimeDatabaseService.js → BookingsDisplay.jsx → User Interface
```

1. **Data Source**: Firebase Realtime Database (`bookings` collection)
2. **Service Layer**: `realtimeDatabaseService.js` handles data fetching
3. **Component**: `BookingsDisplay.jsx` renders the UI
4. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic updates when bookings change

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- **Bootstrap Cards**: For booking display
- **React Bootstrap**: For responsive layout

- **Badge Components**: For status indicators
- **Form Controls**: For search functionality

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- No sensitive payment information displayed
- Public access (no authentication required)
- Search limited to basic customer information
- Firebase security rules should restrict write access

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

- Fully responsive design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized for all screen sizes

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **QR Code Integration**: Generate QR codes for bookings

5. **Booking Modifications**: Allow customers to modify bookings
6. **Payment Integration**: Online payment status tracking

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
